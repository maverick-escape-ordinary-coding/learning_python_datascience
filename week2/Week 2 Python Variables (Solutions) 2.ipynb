    "Variables are containers for storing data values. They are created by assigning a value to them using the assignment operator `=`. In Python, you do not need to explictly define what data-type a variable uses unlike other languages such as Java or C++. Python will implicitly decide this out by looking at the type of value that is being assigned. So if you are assigning an integer value the variable is an integer or if you assign a string the variable is a string. Later in this Notebook, we will look at the different kinds of data we can store in a variable, known as its data type."

    "Normally, you would execute cells in the order they are included in the Notebook. However, please be aware that it is the order of execution of cells that is important in a Jupyter Notebook, not necessarily the order in which they appear. Python will remember all the code that was run previously, including any variables you have defined, irrespective of the order in the Notebook. Therefore if you define variables lower down the Notebook and then (re)run cells further up, those defined further down will still be present. Variables persist between cells as you have already no doubt experienced. This is one of the most useful facilities within the Jupyter system. It allows you to break down complex data science investigations into smaller units of work.\n",

Or, we could set variable `x` equal to `1` and variable `y` equal to `2` and add these two variables together and store the result in `zz`. This is the one of the strengths of programming. We can capture the behaviour of adding of two values together without fixing which two values are added. This way we can use this addition functionality for any two numeric values we wish simply by setting `x` and `y` accordingly. We can go further an build algebriac formulae into a program thereby gaining all the benefits of the mathematical way of thinking."

For example, assume that we have an mathematical expression (`area = (base/2)*height`) that calculates the area of a triangle but that the variables `base` and `height` are strings. This is not an unrealistic scenario. Data comes in many different forms. To perform this calculation without error, the programmer will need to convert the string representation of the value into an float before it can be used in the expression. Execute the code below and you will see an error is produced."
