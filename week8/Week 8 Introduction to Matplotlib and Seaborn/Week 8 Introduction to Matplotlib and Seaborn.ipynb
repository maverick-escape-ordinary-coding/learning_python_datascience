    "Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. One of Matplotlib’s most important features is its ability to play well with many operating systems and graphics backends. Matplotlib supports dozens of backends and output types, which means you can count on it to work regardless of which operating system you are using or which output format you wish. This cross-platform, everything-to-everyone approach has been one of the great strengths of Matplotlib. It has led to a large user base, which in turn has led to an active developer base and Matplotlib’s powerful tools and ubiquity within the scientific Python world."

    "Aside from the different features available in ``plt.plot`` and ``plt.scatter``, why might you choose to use one over the other? While it doesn't matter as much for small amounts of data, as datasets get larger than a few thousand points, ``plt.plot`` can be noticeably more efficient than ``plt.scatter``.\n",
    "The reason is that ``plt.scatter`` has the capability to render a different size and/or color for each point, so the renderer must do the extra work of constructing each point individually.\n",
    "In ``plt.plot``, on the other hand, the points are always essentially clones of each other, so the work of determining the appearance of the points is done only once for the entire set of data.\n",
    "For large datasets, the difference between these two can lead to vastly different performance, and for this reason, ``plt.plot`` should be preferred over ``plt.scatter`` for large datasets."
