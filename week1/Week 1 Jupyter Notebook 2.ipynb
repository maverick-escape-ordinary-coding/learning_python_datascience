However, you should avoid doing this as it can be confusing to anyone else reading your source code.\n",

However, the key difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, i.e. they cannot change once initialised. In addtion, tuples use `()` brackets (instead of `[]` brackets) to define their elements. Two good reasons to use a tuples over lists to store data are:\n",
    "1. Due to their immutable nature, tuples are faster to access than lists\n",
    "2. Tuples can lead to safer code by effectively 'write-protecting' data\n",

    "Week 5 focuses on building algorithmic solutions to programming problems and introduces functions as a solution to help with this process. Weeks 2-4 introduce the fundamental features of the Python programming language and focus very much on practical experience of using these features. In Week 5 we will bring these features together to start solving realistic and relevant programming problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Solving\n",
    "Structured programming is a method of programming designed to help make large programs easier to read. It is aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs. Python programs are composed of one or more of the following structures: Sequences, Selection and Iteration. Sequences are simply a group of python statements which are executed in sequence. Selections are choices that can be added to a program to execute sequences dependent upon some condition, e.g. if x = 5 then perform sequence A otherwise perform sequence B. Finally, iterations are sequences of statements that are repeated multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind structured programming is to divide and conquer. As computers, technology, and software have advanced, programs have become larger and more difficult to write and maintain. Structured programming breaks down complex programs into simple tasks. The rule of thumb is that if a task is too complex to be described simply, then the task needs to be broken down further. When the task is small enough to be self contained and easily understood , then the task can be programmed. Structured programming gave rise to a number of other movements, Object-Oriented Programming being one of the more important ones. We will look at this in Week 9 of the module."

    "## Week 8 Preview - matplotlib and seaborn\n",

Matplotlib was designed to provide an easy way to generate plots using built-in data structures (such as Lists) and, in particular, NumPy arrays. Seaborn is based on matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. You should become familiar with both these options so that you can make a value judgement on which one to use in a given scenario.\n",

Each time you execute the cell, 10000 new random values will be generated and the plot will look different. Try executing the cell a few times to validate this. Now try increasing the number of random values that are used. And execute it again. Is there any significant difference in the plot that is generated?"

This is achieved through complex algorithms and data management techniques like classification, regression and clustering.

In supervised learning, all training samples have input values and a known outcome while in unsupervised learning only the input data is available.\n",
